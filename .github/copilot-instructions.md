# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Copilot and other coding agents should follow the contributor playbook in `../AGENTS.md`. Read that file first and keep your suggestions, edits, and testing aligned with its guidance. When you are asked to update this file, instead only update the relevant sections of the playbook in `../AGENTS.md`.
